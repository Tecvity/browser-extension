# ZAP Browser Extension

A browser extension which allows [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) to interact directly with the browser.

[![ZAP Chat: Modern Apps Part 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Rq_d7OLmMfw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq_d7OLmMfw)

Works in both Firefox and Chrome but does not provide any useful functionality unless it is used with ZAP.

Initially generated from https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/web-extension-starter/tree/react-typescript

Only Firefox and Chrome have been tested - Opera may or may not work :wink:

The latest published extensions are also available via the relevant stores:
